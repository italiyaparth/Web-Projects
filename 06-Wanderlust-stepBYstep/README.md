  - icons = FontAwesome ( cdn links )
  - fonts = Google Fonts ( cdn links )
  - rating star = github.com/LunarLogic/starability ( copy raw code )

# Step 1 - Basic Set Up

- Sub-Directories ( our main directory is "01-WANDERLUST" )

  - init = initializing our app ( Files to store sample data in database )
  - public = static files ( css stylesheets )
  - views = ejs web page files
  - models = different model files as per different styles of Schema ( collection )
  - utils = extra .js files ( error class, error catching function )
  - routes = routes for different collections
  - controllers = routes function files (e.g. async(req,res) => {...})

-- In VS Code Terminal

  - npm init -y
  - npm i express
  - npm i ejs
  - npm i mongoose
  - touch app.js    ( "app.js" is our main file which we will run through "nodemon" )

-- In app.js

  - write some basic code, start server ( app.listen... )
  - write some basic code, connect to MongoDB ( mongoose.connect... )

-- In VS Code Terminal

  - nodemon app.js  ( after some coding in it )

# Step 2 - Making Model

- Home Page of our web app will have all listings of places( Apartment, Villa, Flat, etc ).
- These places will have title, description, image, price, location, country, etc.

- So, we will make "Listing" Model ( Meaning, We will have "listings" named collection In "wanderlust" named database of MongoDB ).

- In this "Listing" model, we have our documents ( data of documents which will come from sample data when we execute Step 3 )

-- In models/listing.js

    - write some code, create Schema, create model, export model

-- In app.js

    - require above "Listing" model

# Step 3 - Initialize Database

- We will store some data( documents ) in "listings" collection.

-- In init/data.js

    - In here, we have sample data( Array of Objects( documents ) ).
    - export that data ( array )

-- In init/index.js

    - require data from data.js
    - require Listing from listing.js
    - create connection to MongoDB
    - add data into MongoDB

-- In VS Code Terminal ( init directory - only one time to add sample data )

    - node index.js

# Step 4 - Index Route

- Home Page
- GET   /listings   - All listings ( index.ejs )

-- In app.js

    - app.get...
    - require path, app.set..., app.set...
    - render listings/index.ejs

-- In views/listings/index.ejs

    - set all listings ( unordered list for now )
    - set anchor tag to show specific listing data when clicked

# Step 5 - Show Route ( READ )

- View specific listing data ( when clicked from views/listings/index.ejs )
- GET   /listings/:id   - Specific listing data ( show.ejs )

-- In app.js

    - app.use... ( to parse url data )
    - app.get...
    - find listing document by id
    - render listings/show.ejs

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - set listing data ( unordered list for now )

# Step 6 - New & Create Route ( CREATE )

- Add New listing Page
- GET   /listings/new   - New listing form ( new.ejs )
- POST  /listings/:id   - Add New listing data into Database

-- In listings/index.ejs

    - add "New" form button
    - set action attribute for GET method to "/listings/new"

-- In app.js

    - write this method above step 5 app.get method
    - app.get...
    - render listings/new.ejs

-- In views/listings/new.ejs

    - set up form for new listing details addition
    - set action attribute for POST method to "/listings"

-- In app.js

    - app.post...
    - add data into database
    - redirect to "/listings" page

# Step 7 - Edit & Update Route ( UPDATE )

- Edit listing Page from specific listing detail page ( Step 5 )
- GET   /listings/:id/edit   - edit listing form ( edit.ejs )
- PUT  /listings/:id   - Add updated listing data into Database

-- In listings/show.ejs

    - add "Edit" anchor tag
    - set attribute href to "/listings/:id/edit"

-- In app.js

    - app.get...
    - find listing data by id
    - render listings/edit.ejs

-- In VS Code Terminal

    - npm i method-override

-- In app.js

    - require method-override
    - app.use...

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs

    - set up form for listing details to be updated
    - set action attribute to "/listings/:id?_method=PUT"

-- In app.js

    - app.put...
    - update data by id into database
    - redirect to `/listings/${id}` page

# Step 8 - Delete Route ( DELETE )

- DELETE  /listings/:id   - delete listing

-- In listings/show.ejs

    - add "Delete" button in form
    - set action attribute to "/listings/:id?_method=DELETE"

-- In app.js

    - app.delete...
    - delete by id into database
    - redirect to "/listings" page

# Step 9 - Creating Boilerplate

- We write same code block for many different ejs files 
- but now we write this code block only one time and export it to these different ejs files

-- In VS Code Terminal

    - npm i ejs-mate

-- In app.js

    - require ejs-mate
    - app.engine...

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - this code block will be in all other ejs files, so we will make it only one time
    - body will be different of all other ejs files so add this code of line in body:
        <div class="container"><%- body %></div>
    
- Now, remove all codes from ejs files except for body and add this code of line:
        <% layout("/layouts/boilerplate") %>


- Make a public directory and css a sub directory

-- In public/css/style.css

    - write simple style to test it out

-- In app.js

    - app.use... for access of public folder

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - link stylesheet: "/css/style.css"

# Step 10 - Navbar

- We will use pre-built css from Bootstrap

- From Bootstrap website, copy link tag from getting started/inroduction page => 2. code block
and paste in boilerplate

--  In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - From Bootstrap website, copy link tag from getting started/inroduction page => 2. code block
    - paste it above </head>
    - Also, copy script and paste just above </body>

--  In views/includes/navbar.ejs

    - From components/navbar, copy code block of anchor tag version from simple Nav#  and paste it

--  In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - write this code block ( here at the top - below <body> ) to include above navbar:
        <%- include("../includes/navbar.ejs") %>

--  In views/includes/navbar.ejs

    - change some name of the classes so it will be according to our own custom style
    - replace "bg-body-tertiary" with "bg-body-light"
    - remove disabled anchor tag
    - according to our pages, change in anchor tags like href, text content, etc.
      - 1 for All Listing
      - 2 for Add New Listing
    - remove class active of anchor tag
    - remove aria-current property of anchor tag

    - navbar from Bootstrap is responsive, we will add some of the classes for more responsiveness
       -  replace "navbar-expand-large" with "navbar-expand-md"

-- In views/listings/index.ejs

    - remove form tag from which we would navigate to adding new listing


- Add New Icons - from fontawesome website

    - search for your icon and copy tag: 
        "<i class="fa-regular fa-compass"></i>"
    
--  In views/includes/navbar.ejs

    - paste it in text content of anchor tag which has class="navbar-brand"
    - in the href="" add link to home page

--  In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - For this icon to work, we have add cdn link tag which we will copy
    - from cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome, paste it above </head>

-- In public/css/style.css

    - we add some custom styles, for this override effect of bootstrap, we have include "!important"
    - add style for .navbar height
    - add color to fa-compass and font-size
    - update color of "nav-link"

--  In views/includes/navbar.ejs

    - add class"border-bottom" in nav tag, which is default class of bootstrap, which will show border
    - for sticky nav, add built in bootstrap class "sticky-top" in nav tag

-- In public/css/style.css

    - give it bg-color "white" in .navbar

# Step 11 - Footer

-   We will make footer, which will be same in all pages, and include this footer into boilerplate

--  In views/includes/footer.ejs

    - write some code
    - add social icons from fontawesome

-- In public/css/style.css

    - add styles for footer   

--  In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - include above footer in boilerplate, above script tag 
        <%- include("../includes/footer.ejs") %>

# Step 12 - Styling Index ( Home Page )

-   We will make cards, copy from Bootstrap

--  In views/listings/index.ejs

    - paste in here
    - add our details and as per requirement write code
    - for responsiveness, we will wrap whole for loop with div class="row" of Bootstrap
    and as per xs,sm,md,lg,xl add class="row-cols-lg-3 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-sm-1"

-- In public/css/style.css

    - we style index page
    - add google fonts css rules from website and paste it 

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - add google fonts link from website and paste it above </head>

-- In public/css/style.css

    - add hover effect and click effect of card, we wrap caard with anchor tag    

# Step 13 - Styling New Listing

-   We will take class names and labels from form of Bootstrap, copy them

-- In views/listings/new.ejs

    - paste in here as per requirement

-- In public/css/style.css

    - our footer is not sticking to bottom, give body flex.

# Step 14 - Styling Edit Listing

-   We will take class names and labels from form of Bootstrap, copy them

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs

    - paste in here as per requirement

-- In public/css/style.css

    - edit button style change

# Step 15 - Styling Show Listing

- We will take card code block from Bootstrap, copy it and 

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs

    - paste in here as per requirement

-- In public/css/style.css

    - edit and delete button style change

# Step 16 - Client-Side Form Validation

- When we enter data in the form, the browser and/or the web server will check to that
- the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by application

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs & /new.ejs

    - add attribute "required" to the fields of our forms ( input, textarea, ... )
    - In above case, as per browser default error message will appear if fields are empty

- In all browsers, we want our own custom styling of error message, for form validation
- So, we will use Bootstrap => Forms => Validation

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs & /new.ejs

    - add "novalidate" attribute in form tag to remove default validation error messages
    - add " class="needs-validation" " of bootstrap
    - add javascript logic of bootstrap for above class "needs-validation"

-- In public/js/validationScript.js

    - add javascript logic from bootstrap for above class "needs-validation"

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - add script tag    

# Step 17 - Client-Side Form Validation - Success and Failure Text

- We will style validation success or failure message, If data inserted by user is valid or not 

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs & /new.ejs

    - add div inside individual field-div, which has bootstrap class "valid-feedback" & "invalid-feedback"
    - we will add our own messages for valid or invalid content

# Step 18 - Server-Side Errors - wrapAsync function

- Errors will come from MongoDB, when it cannot save data because of defined schema 

-- In utils/wrapAsync.js

    - make "wrapAsync" function to catch errors

-- In app.js

    - require "./utils/wrapAsync.js"
    - pass all async functions to this "wrapAsync" function
    - add our own custom error handling middleware app.use((err, ...)) at last

# Step 19 - Server-Side Errors - ExpressError Class

- We can send our own custom error messages to user

-- In utils/ExpressError.js

    - make "ExpressError" class to define status and message

-- In app.js

    - require ./utils/ExpressError.js"
    - add app.all("*",...), for page which we didn't make ( page not found )
    - send status and message in app.use((err,...))

# Step 20 - Server-Side Errors - Error page

- We will make our own error.ejs which will have error messages

-- In views/error.ejs

    - write code for alert from bootstrap

-- In app.js

    - render "error.ejs" from app.use((err,...)) 

# Step 21 - Server-Side Errors - Schema Validation

- If we add data from hoppscotch, postman, etc; then above form validation won't work
- We have to check individual fields before data is saved in MongoDB
- We will use joi tool in making of schema, which is server-side validation tool

-- In VS Code Terminal

    - npm i joi

-- In schema.js

    - require "joi"
    - make schema validator using "joi"

-- In app.js

    - require "schema.js"
    - add "result = listingSchemaJoiValidator.validate(req.body)" in new & edit route where validator is required
    - throw error if error is there: if(result.error) { throw new ExpresError(...) }

# Step 22 - Server-Side Errors - Schema Validation Middleware

- We can set above schema validation as a middleware

-- In app.js

    - create a only one function "validateSchema" which will validate schema
    - add this function "validateSchema" as middleware in post & put code block

# Step 23 - Creating Review model

- We will create review model, in which we store comment, stars, date-time

-- In models/review.js

    - require mongoose
    - make reviewSchema
    - make model
    - export model

# Step 24 - Attach reviews with listings

- We will add reference (ObjectID) in listingSchema, because it is a "One to Many" database relationship

-- In models/listing.js

    - add "review" key and value as an array of reference of Review model in listingSchema definition

# Step 25 - Create Review form

- We will create review form to get review from user

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - create form for review
    
# Step 26 - Store Reviews in Database

- We will create review route to store reviews in the database. As we store reviews for individual listing, we have route as "listing/:id/reviews

-- In app.js

    - require review model
    - write after delete route of listing

# Step 27 - Client side Validations of reviews

- We will validate form data given by user using default & bootstrap classes in form itself.

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - textarea = add "required"
    - form = add "novalidate" and add class "needs-validation" of bootstrap
    - add some div for error

# Step 28 - Server side Validations of reviews

- We will validate data given by user as per database types and conditions using JOI.
- Define Joi for reviewSchema, make funtion for validation error, pass this function as middleware.

-- In schema.js

    - write codes for Joi reviewSchema

-- In app.js

    - require reviewSchemaJoiValidator
    - make function "validateReview" below "validateListing"
    - write "validateReview" as middleware to post method of review

# Step 29 - Render Reviews

- show reviews in individual listing page

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - add div for showing reviews of this listing

-- In app.js

    - add "populate" method in app.get of listing, So that we can access data of reviews

# Step 30 - Styling Reviews

- style reviews as cards

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - add bootstrap card classes

# Step 31 - Deleting Reviews

- add delete button, delete route in app.js (/listings/:id/reviews/:reviewId)
- we have to delete review from review collection as well as listing collection

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - add delete button in form

-- In app.js

    - create delete route for review
    - $pull = This operator removes elements from an existing array for all instances of a value or values that match a specified condition. $pull searches as per our condition and pulls that whole referenceID

# Step 32 - Delete Listing

- Delete listing as well as all reference id ( such as reviews ). We will use mongoose middleware for delete

-- In models/listing.js

    - we will create post mongoose middleware here, which will come to effect when we delete any listing

# Step 33 - Express Router

- Express Routers are a way to organize your Express application such that our primary app.js file does not become bloated.

-- In routes/listing.js

    - require express
    - create router object
    - paste listings routes from app.js
    - replace "app" with "router"
    - we will add "/listings" from path in app.js, so remove that from all the paths
    - export "router"
    - cut-paste other required objects, required function which we will use here from app.js ( don't forget to check path when reuire is used )

-- In app.js

    - require router from routes folder give it name as per file name.
    - e.g. const listings = require("./routes/listing.js");
    - connect app.js and routes/listing.js
    - e.g. app.use("/listings", listings);

-- In routes/review.js

    - same as above for routes/listing.js
    - we need id of listing here but id will be app.js file. We will use " { mergeParams: true }", when creating router object as an option.

# Step 34 - Session

- We will use session to store temporary information. npm install express-session

-- In app.js

    - require express-session
    - create sessionOptions object
    - app.use(session(sessionOptions));
    - make some changes to default values cookie such as expires, maxAge (in sessionOptions) to set expiration to our cookies

# Step 35 - Flash

- We will use Flash to send a messages when listing added or updated or deleted, etc. npm install connect-flash

-- In app.js

    - require connect-flash
    - app.use(flash());
    - create a middleware for all flash messages, which can be used in .ejs file directly

-- In routes/listing.js

    - In post, delete, put route create req.flash for successfully adding new listing or delete listing or update listing
    - In get, put route listing does not exist then create error flash for error

-- In routes/review.js

    - In post, delete route create req.flash for successfully adding new review or delete review

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - above "<%- body %>" write "<%- include("../includes/flash.ejs") %>"

-- In views/layouts/flash.ejs

    - use bootstrap alerts to show message ( use variable name from middleware directly in flash.ejs file )

# Step 36 - Authentication

- We will use passport middleware and passport-local for authentication and passport-local-mongoose for MongoDB. npm i passport, npm i passport-local, npm i passport-local-mongoose

-- In models/user.js

    - create model for user
    - passport-local-mongoose adds username & password automatically, so need to define them in schema

-- In app.js

    - require passport, passport-local, user model
    - session will be used in authentication so write passport middleware after session middlewares
    - app.use(passport.initialize());
    - app.use(passport.session()); --- a web application needs the ability to identify users as they browse from page to page. This series of requests and responses, each associated with the same user, is known as a session.
    - passport.use(new LocalStrategy(User.authenticate())); --- use static authenticate method of model in LocalStrategy & authenticate() method generates a function that is used in Passport's LocalStrategy
    - passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser()); & passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser()); --- use static serialize and deserialize method of model for passport session support
    
# Step 37 - Creating Demo User

- We will create a fake user and add it to the database

-- In app.js

    - create a fake user in app.get("/demouser", ... )
    - register(user, password, callback) --- static method of passport-local-mongoose to register a new user instance with a given password & checks if username is unique

# Step 38 - Signup User

- We will make new route for signing up user and add it into the database

-- In routes/usersignup.js

    - require express
    - create router instance
    - require user model
    - require wrapAsync
    - export router
    - create get method for signup form rendering
    - create post method to store data in database --- register(user, password)

-- In app.js

    - require user signup router
    - app.use("/signup", userSignupRouter); --- route middleware

-- In views/users/signup.ejs

    - create form which has username, email, password field

# Step 39 - Signin User

- We will make new route for signin and for checking with the database

-- In routes/usersignin.js

    - require express
    - create router instance
    - require passport
    - export router
    - create get method for signin form rendering
    - create post method to check data in database
    - passport.authenticate(strategy, {options for failure = Redirect Route & Flash visibiltiy} ) is a middleware used for authenticate request

-- In app.js

    - require user signin router
    - app.use("/signin", userSigninRouter); --- route middleware

-- In views/users/signin.ejs

    - create form which has username, password field

# Step 40 - Check if User is Logged in

- We will check if user is logged in before we go to web page for new listing, edit listing, delete listing, .etc.

-- In middleware.js

    - write new our own custom method for checking if user is logged in and handle error if not. req.isAuthenticated() is built-in method of passport
    - export this method

-- In routes/listing.js & routes/review.js

    - require isLoggedIn method of middleware.js
    - set it up before code for webpages comes into effect as middleware in CRUD methods. i.e. router.get("/new", isLoggedIn, ...);, .etc

# Step 41 - Logout User

- we will make new route for sign out

-- In routes/usersignout.js

    - require express
    - require router
    - export router
    - create get route; req.logout() is built-in method of passport

-- In app.js

    - require signout router
    - create middleware for sign out router

# Step 42 - Styling for Signup, Signin, Signout

- we will make links for signup, signin, signout in nav bar

-- In views/includes/navbar.ejs

    - make links for signup, signin, signout
    - ms-auto is bootstrap class which works as follow: margin from start, auto means as much as possible margin
    - req.user stores user object, if it is undefined then user is NOT looged in. BUT we can't access it in ejs so store that in locals

-- In app.js

    - store current logged in user in locals

# Step 43 - Login after SignUp

- Passport's login method automatically establishes a login session. We can invoke login to automatically login a user

-- In routes/usersignup.js

    - write req.login(user, callback) method in router.post method

# Step 44 - post-login Page

- When we try to access some page, website redirect us to login page, after login we will go to another page not the page from where we redirected. To prevent that we will use "originalUrl" key of "req" object. We need redirectUrl only if user is NOT logged in.

-- In middleware.js

    - store req.originalUrl in our custom req.session.redirectUrl variable
    - store redirectUrl in locals and export this method

-- In routes/usersignin.js

    - In router.post, passport.authenticate() method resets the session, that's why we have made new method to store url in locals in middleware.js. So, before authenticate() method, write this callback as middleware
    - require saveRedirectUrl from middleware.js
    - redirect url, take it from locals
    - suppose, we directly click on "signin" then res.locals.redirectUrl is empty (because isLoggedIn method is not triggered), so save "/listings" in locals, too.

# Step 45 - add Owner to the listing

- Only owner of the listing can edit or delete their listing. So, we will add owner key to the listing schema

-- In models/listing.js

    - add owner property in listingSchema. ref: "User" because owner should be registered user.

-- In init/index.js

    - add owner in all data, so all listing has owner. (copy one of the user id from mongosh -> use users -> db.users.find()) and run index.js

-- In routes/listing.js

    - populate owner so that we can see owner in ejs

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - add owner username

-- In routes/listing.js

    - when creating new listing, we have to add owner

# Step 46 - Edit or Delete listing by Owner only

- We will add authorization to the listing, so that only owner can edit or delete listing

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - only show edit & delete button for the owner. set if condition. currUser should exist & currUser has to be same as owner

-- In routes/listing.js

    - add middleware isOwner
    - remove validateListing method to middleware.js file
    - require validateListing from middleware.js

-- In routes/review.js

    - remove validateReview to middleware.js file
    - require validateListing from middleware.js
    
-- In middleware.js

    - create isOwner function which can be export to listing.js and add this function as middleware in methods so that edit,delete route can't be access by non-owners.
    - require listing model
    - require listingSchemaJoiValidator
    - require reviewSchemaJoiValidator
    - require ExpressError

# Step 47 - add author to the review

- Only author of the review can edit or delete their review. So, we will add author key to the review schema

-- In models/review.js

    - add author property in reviewSchema. ref: "User" because author should be registered user.

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - add if condition to show review form only for registered user(currUser)
    - show review author

-- In routes/review.js

    - add author at new review creation.
    - populate author to show author in ejs file
    - add middleware for author is user checking

-- In routes/listing.js

    - populate author (using nested populate) to show author in ejs file

-- In middleware.js

    - create isReviewAuthor function which can be export to review.js and add this function as middleware in methods so that edit,delete route can't be access by non-owners.

# Step 48 - MVC (Model, View, Controller)    

- we will replace all async functions of routes with callback function. Do this for all routes.

-- In controllers/listings.js

    - export async function as per routes name such as index, renderNewForm
    - require needed variables

-- In routes/listing.js

    - require listingController
    - replace async functions with callback function name from controllers/listings.js such as listingController.index, listingController.renderNewForm, .etc

# Step 49 - Router.route

- when we have same path for different methods of route then we can combine them into single Router.route

-- In routes/all js files

    - for same path combine them into single Router.route(path).get(...).put(...)..........

# Step 50 - Review Rating Stars

- We will use "starability" library, for styling ratings. "lunarlogic.github.io/starability" different styles.
- From "github.com/LunarLogic/starability" > starability-css, copy css code and paste it in our folder "public > css > rating.css

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - add rating.css just above </head> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/rating.css">

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - copy from github (html code from readme) and paste it just below rating range. change name of input. we don't have 0 star rating in database so replace 0 with 1.
    - to show static rating copy from github (html code from readme) and paste it below review.comment

# Step 51 - Image Upload

- We will create image upload input in form and upload image in cloud storage and save link in database
- install npm packages -> multer, dotenv, cloudinary, multer-storage-cloudinary

-- In views/listings/new.ejs

    - add "enctype" attribute in <form>
    - change "type" of image input
    - required attribute

- create .env file, create account on cloudinary website and copy keys and paste them in .env

-- In app.js

    - at the TOP, write code for .env config. Now, we can access variables of .env to any other js files

- create cloudConfig.js file, for access to our cloudinary account

-- In cloudConfig.js

    - require cloudinary
    - require multer-storage-cloudinary
    - write config method, in this method name of the key are same as written there and values names can be anything.
    - create storage instance
    - export cloudinary & storage

-- In routes/listing.js

    - require multer
    - require storage from cloudConfig
    - write intialization to set destination for saving image
    - write middleware upload.single("listing[image]") in post route

-- In models/listing.js

    - change image property

-- In controllers/listings.js

    - createListing > add url & filename in database

- for update image and preview image on update page

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs

    - add "enctype" attribute in <form>
    - change "type" of image input
    - to preview image, add img tag

-- In routes/listing.js

    - write middleware upload.single("listing[image]") in put route

-- In controllers/listings.js

    - updateListing > add url & filename in database
    - renderEditForm > for preview image lower the quality of image and pass url to ejs file

# Step 52 - Map (Mapbox)

- We will use Mapbox for dealing with Map. create account on mapbox website & store MAP_TOKEN in .env file
- visit docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example -> basic map for webpage
- npm package @mapbox/mapbox-sdk

-- In views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs

    - copy paste stylesheet link (api) and script link (api) from mapbox website just above </head> tag

-- In views/listings/show.ejs

    - add div for map, give id "map"
    - at the TOP, we will write script tag to store variables which we can access in public/js/map.js directly
    - at the BOTTOM, we will write script tag for public/js/map.js 

-- In public/css/style.css

    - give some style for #map (e.g. height=400px, width=80vh)

-- In public/js/map.js

    - here, we will write code for map & map marker
    - Popup method to show popup when clicking the marker

-- In controllers/listings.js

    - require @mapbox/mapbox-sdk/services/geocoding to use Geocoding
    - initailize geocodingClient
    - in createListing function, write mapbox code to convert location to coordinates
    - in createListing function, write code to store coordinates in databse

-- In models/listing.js

    - add "geometry" property to store coordinates in schema
    - mapbox gives GeoJSON format & MongoDB can store GeoJSON format.

# Step 53 - Filters

- We will create filters, so that when checked, lisitng will be as per category

-- In models/lisitng.js & In schema.js

    - add category property for filters

-- In views/listings/index.ejs

    - add form div for filters
    - write code for checkbox in script tag

-- In pcontrollers/listings.js

    - in index method, filter in database
    - single filter style update when clicked
    - single is done, but multiple pending

-- In public/css/style.css

    - add style for filters

-- In init/index.js

    - add category to data randomly

-- In views/listings/new.ejs

    - add dropdown for category

-- In views/listings/edit.ejs

    - add dropdown for category

# Step 54 - Hosting

- Mongo Atlas - Cloud Database Service, create account 
- for session storage, we will use connect-mongo npm package
- we will host our application on render

-- In .env

    - add mongo url from atlas database (our account)

-- In app.js

    - replace mongo_url with online atlas mongo url from .env file
    - require connect-mongo
    - create Mongo store to use in middleware later
    - add this store in sessionOptions    

-- In package.json

    - at the top in curly braces, add "engines" & add value of node version

-- console for git upload

    - git init
    - git status = you can see commits & non-commits
    - touch .gitignore = in which we will write file or folder names which we will not upload (e.g. .env node_modules/)  (if we want to delete some file (.abc) in every folder then write **/.abc)
    - git add . = add all
    - git commit -m "Add Project Files"
    - git branch -M main
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/italiyaparth/01-Wanderlust.git
    - git push -u origin main

- connect github with render

-- In render.com

    - web service
    - connect with github repo
    - buil command = npm install
    - start command = node app.js
    - advanced > auto deploy = no
    - create service

    - add environment variable = click on Environment
    - add environment variables from .env file

    - at right top corner > connect > we will have 3 ip adderesses
    - Go to ATLAS and copy these ips paste it "Network Access" > new ip address

    - on render, manual deploy > clear build cache & deploy

- https://delta-project-0e9j.onrender.com
